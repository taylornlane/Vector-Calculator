# Vector-Calculator

This is a fully functional Vector Calculator designed to perform various vector operations such as addition, subtraction, dot product, and more. I decided to start this project while completing my Calculus III class because I got tired of repeating the same labor-intensive vector calculations again and again. Originally developed in C++, the project was later translated into JavaScript to create an interactive web-based tool. The web interface is built using HTML and CSS, providing a clean and user-friendly experience.

Features:
- Vector addition and subtraction, and projection
- Dot product and cross product calculation
- Magnitude and normalization of vectors
- Angle between vectors
- Interactive web interface for seamless vector operation input
- Responsive design using HTML/CSS for a smooth user experience
Technologies Used:
- C++: Original implementation
- JavaScript: Translated logic for web interactivity
- HTML/CSS: Web interface design and styling
How to Use:
- Enter vector components in the provided fields.
- Choose the desired operation (e.g., addition, dot product).
- Click "Calculate" to get the result.
